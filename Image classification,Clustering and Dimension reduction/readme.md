# Image classification,Clustering and Dimension reduction


◦ Modified existing CNN model to classify bees versus ant to test learning rates and momentum.

◦ Obtained best validation accuracy of 93.46% for modified CNN model.

◦ Performed data pre-processing using various transforms and extracted new features for clustering.

◦ Trained and visualised the effect of k in k-Means clustering and selected best k by elbow method.

◦ Applied PCA and kernal PCA for reducing number of dimensions based on variance explained.
