Image Caption Generator with CNN & LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
  
◦ Studied about the CNN and LSTM to create a working model of an image caption generator.

◦ Extracted image features from a CNN model (Xcepition) which is pretrained on imagenet data set.

◦ Applied extracted features to LSTM-RNN to generate the caption of image and evaluated the result.
